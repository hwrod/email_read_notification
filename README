Email Read Notification

Emails a notification when someone has viewed your email.

Usage: Send your email in HTML format and include an image with URL pointing to this script.

Set an id parameter to identify the email (such as the email subject or a numeric ID), like: 
<img src="http://example.com/img.php?id=Welcome%20Friend">
which will email you a notification that the recipient has opened your "Welcome Friend" email.
